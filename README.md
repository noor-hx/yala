Don't worry; this virtual-assistant interface will help you 🤖. 
You only need to say "calculate" and input your travel history dates from and to the country. This interface will do the rest ✅.

**Note: if your elligible for FCR, this interface will prepare you a csv file to print ✅✅. Otherwise, the program will autumatically exit.** 

The program consists of two main parts.
1. Interactive part: This part contains two functions: `speech`, and `order`. While the former speech listens to the user's auditory orders and acts accordingly, the latter speaks back to him/her.

2. Calculating part: This part contains a main function and four other functions: `confirm_leaving_date`, `confirm_entery_date`, `calculate`, and `table`. The main function is called from the interactive part. It performs calculations on the user's inputs and sorts them into readable data.
